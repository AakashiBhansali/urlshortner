URLShortner is a simple project to which converts long URLs to shot URLS.

### Tech

URLShortner uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Python] - High level language for software development
* [Django] - Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
* [MongoDB] - MongoDB is an open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.

And of course MERNChart itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

URLShortner requires Python3.x to run

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd MERNChart
$ pip install -r requirement.txt
$ python manage.py runserver
```
